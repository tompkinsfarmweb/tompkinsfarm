# 𓆏 TOMPKINS FARM WEBSITE
## 𓆏 𓆏 𓆏 First Draft Report

---

#### The first prototype of the website is online! View it [here](wikipedia.org).

---

##### Here are some general notes on the state of the website:

* the website is responsive - the layout will change with the size of screen, and will automatically use a mobile layout on phones
    * however, the mobile navigation menu ("hamburger" button __≡__) does not work because i need to write some javascript for it
    * the navigation bar can also be set up to stick to the top of the page when scrolling if we want

* i need to do custom styling, but i need to learn how to do so with the framework i'm using (bulma.io)
    * this includes the background, size of the logo on the top left, etc.
    * should just require some reading and learning on my end

* we need social media links
    * i will likely place these at the page footers (where it says Overview, Modifiers, Grid, Elements, Components, Layout)
    * also needed for contact page and potentially navigation bar

* putting a news feed / social media feed on the homepage may be worth looking into

##### The following details my notes on each page:



> #### index.html (homepage)
> * the links to the pages are contained in the "CLICK TO SEE MORE" text, but this can be changed such that each entire square card (including image, text, and the white box around it) is a button
>
> #### about.html
> * needs content
> * need to figure out how to shrink that massive image
> #### services.html
> * needs content
> * need to figure out how to shrink that massive image
> #### roster.html
> * needs content, each artist will have their own page as well.
>
> #### contact.html
> * the contact form doesn't work, it is just placeholder.
>     * i can probably make it work but need to brush up on javascript
> * also needs social media links and other contact info
>
> #### news.html
> * there is currently one placeholder news article
>    * the format is incomplete, it will be timestamped and text will be left-aligned
> * adding a news article currently requires me to add it by hand in code (which is still extremely quick because I can copy and paste the format and just change the text)
>   * hopefully down the line i can develop a system to add new articles without editing the code by hand
